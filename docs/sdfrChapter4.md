### How to set up Simple Signature to work with custom documents, either through a Document Generation app, or via code…
# S
imple Signature is intended to be “simple”, but the one complicated part about it is to create the actual documents where the final signature is supposed to go.  For those geeks who love to code, creating VisualForce pages might be simple, and even fun, but for the majority of people, this might be outside of our toolbox.  For those people, we have three options:

⦁	To A Finish, the creator of Simple Signature, offers a service to  `create VisualForce forms` for your organization.  Depending on how complicated your document is, they might typically cost a few hundred dollars to build.  Contact ⦁	sales@toafinish.com or head on over to the ⦁	www.simplesignatureapp.com website to explore this option in more detail.  The good part of making VisualForce documents is that they can look exactly like you want them, and once they are built, there is no further cost to use them.  But the downside is that if you ever need to change them, you have to go back through the process of hiring somebody again.

Additionally, you also have two Apps that work nicely with Simple Signature and provide document generation.  (Descriptions below from their websites…)

⦁	COOLDOX is a MS-Word Add-in developed to help Salesforce user in creating impressive, rich-text documents like Sales proposals (Quotes), Customer contracts/agreements, and other documents. You can create new templates, import your existing templates from Salesforce, modify them and create rich documents to impress your customers. Documents generated using COOLDOX are immediately available in Salesforce, you can start sharing it with your colleagues or send to customers.

⦁	S-Docs is an add-on that generates quotes, contracts, invoices, reports and any other document directly on Salesforce. S-Docs was developed on the force.com platform exclusively for Salesforce with features far superior to the out-of-box capabilities. It's 100% Native - running entirely on the Salesforce Cloud, so it stands alone as the only document generator that does not rely on external servers. Therefore S-Docs is the most secure, fastest, easiest to use and most cost effective solution on the AppExchange.
