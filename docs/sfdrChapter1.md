![alt text](images/src8.png "Signature Process")

Salesforce.com's CRM solution is broken down into several broad categories: Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Data Cloud (including Jigsaw), Collaboration Cloud (including Chatter) and Custom Cloud (including Force.com).  Below, we’ll highlight a few of them.


### The Sales Cloud

The Sales Cloud includes a real-time sales collaborative tool called Chatter, provides sales representatives with a customer profile and account history, allows the user to manage marketing campaign spending and performance across a variety of channels from a single application, tracks opportunity-related data including milestones, decision makers, customer communications, and other information unique to the company's sales process. Automatic email reminders can be scheduled to keep teams up to date.

Other activities on the Salesforce cloud include using the Jigsaw business data to access business contacts, and designing and automating processes in Salesforce CRM.

### The Service Cloud

The Service Cloud provides companies with a call center-like view that enables them to create and track cases coming in, and automatically route and escalate what’s important. The Salesforce CRM-powered customer portal provides customers the ability to track their own cases, includes a social networking plug-in that enables the user to join the conversation about their company on social networking websites, provides analytical tools and other services including email, chat, Google search, and access to customers' entitlement and contracts. 

### The Force.com Platform

Salesforce.com's platform as a service (PaaS) product is known as Force.com. The Force.com platform allows external developers to create add-on applications that integrate into the main salesforce.com application and are hosted on Salesforce.com's infrastructure.
These applications are built using Apex (a proprietary Java-like programming language for Force.com) and VisualForce (an XML-like syntax for building user interfaces in HTML or Flex).

### Web Services

In addition to the web interface, salesforce.com offers a SOAP/REST Web service API that enables integration with other systems.

> # Introducing To A Finish

To A Finish™ is a concept company that has grown out of a desire to improve the Salesforce CRM consulting industry. Too often we have found the priorities of consulting companies skewed towards speed and profitability, rather than excellence and long-term success. This is not a blanket statement about all consulting companies, rather a general statement of the industry at large.

We believe there is a different way of consulting that will bring ultimate success to any CRM venture. The biggest difference is time. We give special attention to steps that are often rushed or even overlooked entirely in a typical project. Things like in-depth analysis, getting to really know a business, documentation and end-user involvement in the process help us set up a project for success. Ultimately, we must spend the time to do the work until it is absolutely complete; To A Finish™.

We are not guaranteeing our clients will never see a bug or have to rethink initial strategies. Reworking is actually part of the process of achieving success. What we are saying is that our strategies and focus will minimize unforeseen problems and achieve for us an ultimately successful project completion. We put our name on our work and stake our reputation on quality service.
Test us. Allow us to show you the difference of doing work To A Finish™.
